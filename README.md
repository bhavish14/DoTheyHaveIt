# DoTheyHaveIt?

An angular + node.js based project that allows you to search across major retailers like Walmart, target, etc. 
and get the inventory for the item youâ€™re looking for. Rather than driving to the store only to realize that one jug 
of milk is no longer available, this project lets you to search for the inventory before hand. Visit that one store 
instead of many.
